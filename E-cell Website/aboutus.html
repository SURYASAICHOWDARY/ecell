        <h1>E-cell,NIT-SILCHAR <br> Startup Center  </h1>
        <p>The capacity and willingness to develop, organize and manage a business venture along
            with any of its risks in order to make a profit is what distinguishes businessman from
            an entrepreneur. E-Cell, NIT Silchar or Entrepreneurship Cell of National Institute of
            Technology, Silchar is a non-profit organization run by the students of NIT Silchar
            established with the aim to promote entrepreneurship and start-ups within the
            college. In a world where every man is a company himself by the virtue of his ideas, we
            thrive to develop the attitude of self-dependency among our college students. Keeping
            an aim of fostering nurturing the spirit of entrepreneurship in the youth of NIT Silchar,
            we at E-Cell, NIT Silchar have conceptualized & successfully implemented various initiatives
            to help students, young entrepreneurs & professionals in their entrepreneurial journey.
